# utils
Various small tools that I use to make my life easier.

Currently contains:

 * `ftc` - a short script to print all the files in a particular directory + subdirectories which contain a particular string.

 * `ytsrt.py` - a short program for converting YouTube XML subtitles into SRT format.

 * `intsum`, `fpsum` - tiny F77 programs which sum all the numbers from `stdin` and put the output on `stdout`.  `intsum` does integer math, `fpsum` double precision floating point.

 * `dir` - a shell wrapper to be more like the behaviour of DOS dir (WRT pagination, order) than GNU dir.
